    Note: Generally, we prefer development work to happen during normal business hours and be requested and scheduled at least
    48 hours ahead of time. Such work will be billed at an hourly rate of $100/hour. Smaller blocks of unscheduled work
    may be requested, but such work may be billed at a higher rate as described above. We ask for a deposit of 50% or $2000 (whichever is less) to start work on a project.</p>
