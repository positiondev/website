* Start and end dates (cli feedback should help admin understand when the sale will end)
* Customer sees countdown as end date approaches
* all site-wide sales are worldwide and public (applied automatically to every cart)
* A command line flash should advertise the sale
* Distinct % discounts for each product format
* There can only be one site-wide sale at a time
* Should be able to stack with code-based discounts
