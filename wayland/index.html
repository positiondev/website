      <p><strong>Wayland is a platform built specifically for magazines. It combines the ease-of-use and familiarity of WordPress as a content management system while integrating core magazine features such as digital/print subscriptions, subscriber management, and an online store.</strong></p>

      <p>Wayland is a full featured subscription and fulfillment system that was originally developed for <a href="https://jacobinmag.com">Jacobin</a>, and is currently being adapted for others. Wayland has been used by Jacobin since 2013, and Bhaskar Sunkara has attributed part of Jacobin's rapid growth to Wayland - Wayland eliminated the need for manually updating spreadsheets and copying data from PayPal.</p>

      <p>Wayland gives publications a platform to accept subscriptions and manage subscribers: it keeps track of addresses (and can remind your subscribers to update them before each issue is mailed), exports lists for distributors, supports gift subscriptions and donations (both recurring and one-time), discount codes, institutional subscriptions (which give access to IP address ranges, assuming you use the paywall), a mailing list (for both subscribers and for anyone else you want to load into it), a store for products and back issues, and a basic paywall (the kind where specific articles are pay-walled, not where you get a certain number of views per month).</p>

      <p>It also integrates tightly with Wordpress for content management.</p>

      <p>With Wayland, administrators have an area separate from editorial content where they can deal with all of the subscriber support (resetting passwords, giving subscribers extra issues if needed, cancelling subscriptions or refunding payments if subscribers are unable to do so on their own, etc). Administrators are also able to create mailing lists for mass-email - which can be targeted; by default there are segments for active subscibers, recently expired subscribers, and long expired subscribers.</p>
