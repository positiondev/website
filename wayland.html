We have a full featured subscription / fulfillment system that was originally developed for Jacobin but we've been adapting it for others. It has been running for Jacobin for two and a half years, and Bhaskar (the editor) attributes it to be part of the reason that Jacobin has been able to grow so fast (previous to this system they had a system involving spreadsheets and manually copying data from paypal, etc...).</p>

<p>The system obviously does the basics of accepting subscriptions, but it also keeps track of addresses (reminding people to update them before each issue is mailed), exports lists for distributors, has gift subscriptions, donations (recurring/one-time), discount codes, institutional subscriptions (which give access to IP address ranges, assuming you use the paywall), a mailing list (for both subscribers and for anyone else you want to load into it), a store for products / back issues, and a basic paywall (the kind where specific articles are pay-walled, not where you get a certain number of views per month).</p>

<p>It integrates tightly with Wordpress, which is our recommended way of doing the online publishing part.</p>

<p>There is an administrative section of it where you can deal with all of the subscriber support stuff (resetting passwords, giving people extra issues if needed, cancelling subscriptions or refunding payments if people can't on their own, etc). That's also the place where you can send out bulk mail (which can be targeted; you can segment the list if you want; by default there are segments for active subscibers, recently expired subscribers, and long expired subscribers).

              <!-- To create subscription:
                   1. Find token in management console. Should be a POST to /tokens
                   2. Run the following command, with the correct sk (note trailing colon to go after it, so it doesn't prompt for password), that token, and their email address.
