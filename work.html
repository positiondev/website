              <p>Position Development is a small, worker-run software development company, with a focus on social justice and independent media and we're looking for developers who want to join us.</p>

<p>Our core business idea is that by organizing a team that specializes in the needs of independent/radical media, and by being worker run -- without owners skimming off the top -- we can serve the software needs of these organizations that we care about better and cheaper than anyone else. We've already got some great clients and it seems to be working.</p>

<p>Some of our current clients include Verso Books, The Criterion Collection, The New Inquiry, and Jacobin Magazine.</p>

<p>Also –this is important– we're interested in actively supporting workplace diversity. We are committed to welcoming people that belong to groups that are underrepresented or have been excluded from the software industry.</p>

<p>If that sounds interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you. Please send a resume and brief description of why you're interested to <a href="mailto:workers@positiondev.com">workers@positiondev.com</a></p>

            <div class="section-content">

                <p>We're looking for an experienced developer to join our team. Ideally you've built and maintained customer-facing production web applications. It's a plus if your past work has dealt with money, background data processing, or anything else beyond simple CRUD. We use automated testing extensively and would expect you to be familiar with that process. Some of our work involves maintaining and improving large legacy code bases and we hope you'd be excited to take that on. Our team works on many projects and being interested in this role should mean that at times you can be responsible for driving a given project. That could include figuring out requirements, implementing features, testing, and delivering the result.</p>

<p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $60-80/hr based on experience, eventually transitioning to ownership and cooperative profit sharing.
</p>

<p><strong>Technologies We Use</strong>: Ruby on Rails, Javascript (client-side), Haskell, Postgres/MySQL, Git, AWS, Heroku.</p>

<p><strong>Schedule</strong>: 20-40 hrs/week (flexible)<br>
<strong>Location</strong>: New York, NY
</p>
<p><strong>Application Deadline</strong>: July 1st, 2015.<br>
<strong>Tentative Start Date</strong>: July 15th, 2015

                <p>We're looking for a software developer with one to two years experience who is excited by our mission and the projects we're working on. You should have built a few web applications or other similar projects, and want to improve your craft. This role will involve working closely and learning from more experienced developers. Some of that will be dedicated pair programming, but you will also take on smaller projects or parts of large projects, with guidance available as-needed.</p>
