          <h2>We're looking for people to join us.</h2>

          <p>
            Position Development is a worker-run software
            development company, with the possibility of expanding
            as a full-service firm, with software development at
            our core. We are selective with clients and place
            strong emphasis on independent media, cultural
            institutions, socially minded organizations, and
            opportunities to grow our collective skill sets for
            unique and creative projects.
          </p>

          <p>
            The way we work is based on the particular needs of
            our workers. There is no management layer dictating
            from on-high. Position Development is worker-run,
            which means we collectively decide how we want to
            work.
          </p>

          <p>Currently, our clients include:</p>

          <p>We're looking to expand with like-minded clients, but
            first we need to grow our team!</p>

          <p>We'd love to hear from you. Please send a resume with
            examples of your work, and a one-page description of
            what kinds of projects you're interested in working on
            as well as why you think you’d be a good fit at Position
            Development.</p>

        <div class="section-content">

          <p>We're looking for an experienced developer to join
            our team. Ideally you've built and maintained
            customer-facing production web applications. It's a
            plus if your past work has dealt with money,
            background data processing, or anything else beyond
            simple CRUD. We use automated testing extensively
            and would expect you to as well. Some of our work
            involves maintaining and improving large legacy code
            bases and we hope you'd be excited to take that
            on. Our team works on many projects and part of this
            role will mean that at times you will be responsible
            for taking the lead on a given project. That could
            include working with clients to figure out
            requirements, implementing features, testing, and
            delivering the result.</p>

          <p><strong>Compensation</strong>: $60-80/hr based on
            experience, eventually transitioning to ownership
            and cooperative profit sharing.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Technologies We Use</strong>: Ruby on
            Rails, Javascript (client-side), Haskell,
            Postgres/MySQL, Git, AWS, Heroku.</p>

          <p><strong>Schedule</strong>: 20-40 hrs/week (flexible)<br>
            <strong>Location</strong>: New York, NY
          </p>
