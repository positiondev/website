          <p>We're a software development company that serves leftist and
            independent media companies. We're dedicated to building quality
            software to help expand the breadth of discourse, culture, and thought
            available to English-speaking audiences. We also look for
            opportunities to grow our collective skill sets for unique and
            creative projects.</p>

          <p>We're equally dedicated providing a healthy working environment. We
            believe that developers do their best work when they have plenty of
            time off, and we encourage everyone to work about 30-35 hours per
            week. We like what we do, but we recognize that it is work, not
            <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/in-the-name-of-love/">an act
              of love</a>.</p>

          <p>Our small team is based in a beautiful open office space in Brooklyn,
            New York, that is also a venue for radical activity in the city.</p>

          <p>We’re looking for a developer with at least 3 years of experience to join our team onsite in Brooklyn.</p>

          <h5>Ruby on Rails Developer</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="nine columns">
          <p>You'll be working mainly on our <strong>largest and most successful project</strong>,
          Folio. This Rails application has enabled Verso Books to sell books
          directly to customers over the past five years, and now it’s the
          platform that Haymarket Books and Seven Stories Press use as well.</p>


          <p>We collaborate closely with our clients to make Folio better and
          you would have an important role in making that happen. Direct sales
          through Folio provide a crucial revenue stream for independent
          publishers. By working on Folio, you'll have <strong>daily real-world impact</strong> helping
          them grow and reach new readers.</p>

        <div class="nine columns">
          <p> Depending on your skills and preferences as well as client demand,
          you’ll work on projects from several different clients: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Wayland magazine platform</strong> used by Jacobin,
              Current Affairs, and Dissent. Position maintains several Haskell
              libraries, including a web framework, developed for Wayland.</li>
            <li>An <strong>experimental book search product</strong> built in
              collaboration with book publisher clients. It's built using Java 8,
            Solr, and React. We can’t tell you too much about it yet, but it’s
            very exciting.</li>
            <li>A <strong>custom CRM</strong> for a magazine, written in Python and VueJS</li>
            <li>The Ruby on Rails publishing platform, Folio, described above</li>
            <li>Several other projects in our pipeline, which include data
            migrations, interactive maps, and data visualizations for progressive
            blogs, radical history teachers, and machine learning startups,
            written in Python, React, and/or VueJS.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>While <strong>we work in many different languages</strong>, our
            infrastructure is standardized around Docker and Amazon Web Services.</p>

        <div class="nine columns">

          <p>Monday through Thursday, we write code for clients:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Using test-driven development, you'll <strong>build new features</strong> for web applications.</li>
            <li>We'll review your code, and you'll review our code and give helpful advice.</li>
            <li>You'll <strong>pair program</strong> with other developers about half the time.</li>
            <li>You'll improve the codebases through <strong>refactoring</strong>.</li>
            <li>You'll write unit and integration <strong>tests</strong>.</li>
            <li>You'll use git for version control.</li>
            <li>You'll <strong>debug problems</strong> found by clients and their customers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On Fridays, we do most of the non-client work that keeps Position
            running, including meetings, planning, sales, hiring, and other
            essential functions. We also take this time to improve processes and
            learn new things.</p>

        <div class="nine columns">
          <p>We <strong>collect demographic information</strong> to better
          understand our applicant outreach. This information is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>optional</li>
            <li>anonymous, and</li>
            <li><strong>not attached to your application</strong> in any way.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We’ll use <strong>aggregate</strong> data during the resume review
          stage to learn if we need to do more outreach, and in the future to
          determine if our outreach efforts are improving each year.</p>

          <p>We do <strong>blind resume review</strong> to counter unconscious
          bias. This means a friend of Position will blank out your name and any
          social media handles or personal website URLs before we review your
          resume. Importantly, <strong>we don’t review your website or Github</strong>
          as part of the resume review step. So, if there’s something on your
          Github or website you’d like us to know about, please talk about it in
          your cover letter or resume.</p>

          <p>We use <strong>structured interviewing</strong>. This means that we
            ask every applicant the same basic questions.</p>

          <p>We <strong>value diversity</strong> and encourage applications from
            members of groups underrepresented in tech. We do not discriminate on
            the basis of age, color, creed, disability, gender identity or
            expression, gender, genetics, marital status, military status,
            national origin or ancestry, race, religion, or sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>We provide reasonable accommodations as needed to people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>After we receive your resume, we’ll email you with more detailed
            information about our process. <strong>If you have any questions</strong>,
          drop us a line at <a href="mailto:work@positiondev.com">work@positiondev.com</a>
            and we'll be happy to answer or schedule a call.</p>
