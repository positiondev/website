The AWS account where the positiondev.com and www.positiondev.com
buckets live is owned by the email `dbp@positiondev.com`, which is
a different account from our normal positiondev account.

If you are in the normal positiondev account, you can switch role to:

positiondev-website
admin

And should have access to it.
