            <h3>Matt</h3>

            <p>Matt’s software philosophy is to stay focused on
            identified business needs and to avoid spending time on
            over-engineered solutions. He and his team craft
            understandable, maintainable code that does what it needs
            to do. He has developed skill at this over a 10 year
            career in the software industry serving a variety of happy
            clients.</p>

            <p>In his work as a consultant for Cyrus, Matt experienced
            first-hand the value of highly agile, collaborative, and
            democratic software development teams. In 2014 he
            co-founded Position Development with the mission of making
            a more democratic company.</p>

            <p>Through his network of leftist and progressive media
            makers, Matt has developed a niche for Position as the
            foremost provider of ecommerce and custom web-application
              development for independent media.</p>

            <h3>Libby</h3>

            <p>Libby is a software developer with an interest building
            excellent, sustainable technical infrastructure for
            growing organizations. She’s also long been interested in
            fighting for social justice. Born and raised in West
            Virginia, she didn’t find much support for these interests
            in her home state. In 2014, she received a grant to study
            at the Recurse Center in Manhattan and her life changed
            completely.</p>

            <p>Libby moved to NYC and studied functional programming
            at Recurse Center. After RC, she joined The Learning
            Collective, a group of activists teaching each other to
            create software for power-distant publics. At TLC, she met
            Daniel Patterson, then a worker-owner at Position, who
            encouraged her to apply to work with Position. Libby has
            also spoken at conferences and technical meetups including
            Allied Media Conference, !!Con, AlterConf DC, and Haskell
            Users Group, and is on the leadership committee for the
              MergeSort NYC feminist hackerspace.</p>

            <p>Cassie’s priority is writing high quality software for
            organizations doing important work. She works mostly in
            Ruby and Rails, and is currently interested in creative
            coding and generative lit. In her free time, she
            volunteers for Coalition for Queens and Girl Develop
            It. </p>

            <p>Previously, she worked as a web developer in the
            financial sector, building internal tools for financial
            institutions. Cassie first became interested in
            programming while she was studying public policy and
            English at the University of Chicago. Cassie started at
            Position Development as an apprentice in 2015.</p>
