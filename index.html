            <h3>About Position Development</h3>
            <p>We are a small, worker run software development company, focused

              technology to deliver better software for our clients, so they
              can more effectively carry out their missions.
            </p>


            <p>We create data driven web applications. We have plotted data
              on maps, created historical timelines, analyzed food purchases,
              managed magazine subscribers and order fulfillment, written
              automatic video transcoding, facilitated scheduling of broadcast
              television, worked on ratings and reviews, imported data from
              spreadsheets or documents, and designed systems with
              fine-grained access control.</p>

            <p>We are personable developers with extensive experience using
              Ruby on Rails and the Haskell web framework Snap. We are also
              available to work on existing web applications as well as
              helping to migrate applications towards more modern
              platforms.</p>
