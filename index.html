            <p>I’ve worked closely with Position Development for nearly three
            years, and I’m very happy to highly recommend
            them&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;they’re an unusually talented and
            effective development studio.</p>

            <p>With regular maintenance tasks and smaller projects, where we
              work directly with Position Development, they have been able to
              explain the potential merits and problems of alternative approaches.
              With larger projects&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;where Verso also engages Rumors as a design
              studio&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;Position Development have been very helpful in negotiating
            our various roles, and flexible in adopting extra tasks and/or
            working in different ways with the design team. </p>

            <p> They work as a very effective team, and my management has been
            limited to a weekly review and discussion of projects and tasks
            within JIRA. I’ve been impressed by their assessment and adoption of
            different systems for project-based teamwork. They often work in
            pairs, which seems to work very well. </p>

            <p>We’re very happy with our working relationship with Position
            Development, and very keen to see them grow and take on more
            projects! </p>

            <p>Matt’s software philosophy is to stay focused on
            identified business needs and to avoid spending time on
            over-engineered solutions. He and his team craft
            understandable, maintainable code that does what it needs
            to do. He has developed skill at this over a 10 year
            career in the software industry serving a variety of happy
            clients.</p>

            <p>In his work as a consultant for Cyrus, Matt experienced
            first-hand the value of highly agile, collaborative, and
            democratic software development teams. In 2014 he
            co-founded Position Development with the mission of making
            a more democratic company.</p>

            <p>Through his network of leftist and progressive media
            makers, Matt has developed a niche for Position as the
            foremost provider of ecommerce and custom web-application

            <p>Libby is a software developer with an interest building
            excellent, sustainable technical infrastructure for
            growing organizations. Born and raised in West Virginia,
            she didn’t find much support there for her interests in
            software and social justice. In 2014, she received a grant
            to study at the Recurse Center in Manhattan and moved to
            NYC.</p>

            <p>At Recurse Center, Libby studied functional
            programming. After RC, she joined The Learning Collective,
            a group of activists teaching each other to create
            software for power-distant publics. There she met Daniel
            Patterson, then a worker-owner at Position, who encouraged
            her to apply to work with Position. Libby has also spoken
            at conferences and technical meetups including Allied
            Media Conference, !!Con, AlterConf DC, and Haskell Users
            Group, and is on the leadership committee for the
            MergeSort NYC feminist hackerspace.</p>
